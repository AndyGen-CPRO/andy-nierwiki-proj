						<h3>The End(?)</h3>
						<p>The very first ending that you will get. You will get this ending just by playing through the game.  The playthrough solely only shows Nier’s perspective of the story.  No decisions will have an effect on this ending. After the end credits, you will be able to save your game and you will have to load this to continue the next route of the game which starts at the Act 2 of the game.</p>

					<h2 class="center">Ending B</h2>
					<article class="left">
						<h3>New perspectives...</h3>
						<p>This route expands the game a lot. Shows the detailed backstory of certain characters that Nier knows nothing about. This route also shows new scenes and voice lines that shows the perspective of some of the enemies that Nier encounters in the second part of the game. The climax will run the same way as before but will instead show the perspective of the main antagonist for the ending.</p>

					<h2 class="center">Ending C</h2>
					<article class="right">
						<h3>Without you</h3>
						<p>Load up the Ending B save file to start this route. This route will be the same as before but will show new scenes of one of the masterminds of the game. This ending requires you to have <b>all the 33 weapons</b> of the game to be able to clear it. You do not have to worry about anything that you might have missed on the first act of the game as every weapon will be available in this run, some through weapon purchases, some that gets dropped around the different areas of the game, and some that you can get through side quests. </p>
						<p>Once you have met the requirements, you will now be able to see that the ending that you saw on the two previous routes aren’t quite what they seem. The player will be met with a heavy decision to make in regards to the fate of a certain character. Choose to kill them to see Ending C. After this, it is suggested that you do not overwrite your save file right before you enter the point of no return as you can reach the next ending with just this save file without playing from the beginning of the Act II again.</p>

					</div>
					<h2 class="center">Ending D</h2>
					<article class="left">
						<h3>Without me</h3>
						<p>The "true" ending of the original or the first release of the game. Everything will be the same. If you still have save file right before the point of no return from the previous route, you can load that and avoid redoing all of Act II again. You will start right before the point of no return with all of the weapons available at the game. Reach the ending again, and this time choose to spare the character which carries a heavy cost to the player, all of the save files will be deleted, and thus, finishes the original game and follows up to the game’s sequel NieR Automata which takes place in a completely different age. </p>

					<article class="right">
						<h3>Reunion</h3>
						<p>The main twist of the rerelease, NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... This is a completely new ending from this version of the game. It adds a very satisfying and hopeful conclusion to the story. To see this ending, you will have to start a completely new game after ending D deletes everything. You will also have to use a different player name for this one as it won’t allow you create a save file with your former one.</p>
						<p>You will have to play once again from the beginning as the young boy. You will have to keep playing until you reach the part where you help Kaine enact her life-long objective. From here, the story will take a very hard turn and thus unlocks the new route that takes an hour or two to complete. Play through the new content and finally meet the much happier conclusion to the story of Nier. The credits will roll again for one last time and your save files will finally be recovered. You have completed the game.</p>
