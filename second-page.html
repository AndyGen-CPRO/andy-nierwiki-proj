						<h4>Description</h4>
						<p>Nier (unofficial name) is the protagonist of NieR Replicant. He is a kind young man who would do anything for his little sister. He is very strong even at a young age. Aside from the regular odd jobs, he also accepts jobs that requires him to fight and kill shades. His raw fighting skills while wielding one-handed swords, later with two-handed swords and spears, combined with the magic that he uses from Grimoire Weiss makes him a very competent fighter. </p>
						<p>Despite his appearance of an innocent, pretty, goody two-shoes. He’s already actually went through a lot of things in life before even the beginning of the game. Throughout the game, we can see how all of this reflects to all of his actions, his devotion to his sister, Yonah, and as to how killing seems to only come as a natural thing to him.</p>
